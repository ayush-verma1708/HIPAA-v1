          33. Penalties for Breach of Provisions
        </h3>
        <p>
          (1) If the Board concludes after an inquiry that a person has
          significantly breached the provisions of this Act or its rules, it
          may, after allowing the person an opportunity to be heard, impose a
          monetary penalty specified in the Schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) In determining the monetary penalty amount, the Board shall
          consider:
          <ul>
            <li>The nature, gravity, and duration of the breach.</li>
            <li>
              The type and nature of personal data affected by the breach.
            </li>
            <li>Whether the breach was repetitive in nature.</li>
            <li>
              If the person gained or avoided a loss as a result of the breach.
            </li>
            <li>
              The actions taken by the person to mitigate the breachâ€™s impact,
              including timeliness and effectiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the penalty is proportionate and effective for enforcing and
              deterring future breaches.
            </li>
            <li>The likely impact of the penalty on the person.</li>
